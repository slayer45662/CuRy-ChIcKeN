1. Pulverize the sliced ginger with 1/4 cup water in a mini chopper or a mortar and pestle, until pasty and somewhat blended. The ginger strings will remain; thatâ€™s OK.

2. Measure out the dry spices and place in a small prep bowl.
3. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel and sprinkle salt and black pepper on both sides.

4. Place the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot and warm over medium-high heat. Add the chicken in batches (as needed) and brown on both sides, about 10 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed. Please note that the chicken will not be fully cooked. Transfer to a plate.

5. Lower the heat to medium and add the ginger-water mixture, which may foam upon contact with the pan. Vigorously stir with a wooden spoon, scraping any stuck bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic, chile pepper (if using), spices and salt. The mixture will become pasty, which is a good thing.

6. Return the chicken and residual juices. Lay the cilantro on top like a green carpet. Add the lemon juice and water; if the liquid level seems low (below the chicken), gradually add more to meet the level of the chicken.

7. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook at a simmer until the chicken is tender and starting to fall off the bone, about 45 minutes.

If you time it right, you can make a pot of rice while the curry cooks.
